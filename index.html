      <br><br>Mapping is sort of a procedure about knowledge. Early maps actually bring the cognition of the nature territory for us human, as the artificial device for information containing and circulating. The procedure is also about finding and possessing. So in cause-effect logic, map is the result of recording the physical/tangible findings, but later on also, works as the device that enables people to dominate/politicalize/control/manipulate/improve/change/maintain the actual land they stand on.

      <br>Map on expanding.
      <br>In metaphysical aspect, the procedure of mapping brings a void to conjecture; brings conjecture into knowledge.

      <br><br>In video games, territory usually has some uncertain boundaries into a total void. It is reasonable to admit that extra territory is not needed if no storyline happens outside the current areas.

      <br><br>Continuous narrative
      <br>Consider maps are the great achievement of the Age of Discovery, which also leads to the beginning of globalization and immigration. The information on a map enables people navigate and leads their roads to the cities, where the largely involved community breaks the mono-experienced space of individual’s daily life, and moved the one static, closed, repeated, monotonous to a chaotic, exchangeable, communicated one.

      <p>On Site <br><br>
        In the case of global pandemic, I had to move in this house in March 2020.
        Everything becomes both <i>VIRTUAL</i> but <i>REAL</i>  more than ever.
        <br><br>
        All that's left of my world is the place where I currently live, my computer,
        and the simulacrum of the <i>Real</i> world in my computer. When the physcial
        world eliminates the possiblities of communication, I can only solicit communication
        through the transmission of electronic signals.
        <br><br>
        So, when we found a piece of reality in our backyard - I packed it into an
        electronic signals for transmitting - to enable the communication in the present
        situation and to imagine a <i>physical</i> connection in the future.
